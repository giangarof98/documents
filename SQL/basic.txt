    These commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Data Control Language (DCL):

    permissions and other control-level management tasks for the database system.

SQL databases come in a number of forms, such as Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL. 
Despite their many differences, all SQL databases utilise the same language commands - SQL.

Relational database
    A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in a structured way.
    Data in a relational database is stored in various data tables, each of which has a unique key identifying every row.

    The term “relational database” comes from the concept of a relation—a set of tuples that the database organizes into rows and columns. 
    Each row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values.

    Relational databases use keys to create links between tables. A primary key is a unique identifier for a row of data. 
    A foreign key is a column or combination of columns used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.


Aliases:
    Aliases are used to provide temporary names for tables or columns in a query result.
