Next examples are following the fields from the .sql file attached

Concat
    Combine data for cleaner output
        SELECT CONCAT('h', 'e','l', 'l','o');
        SELECT CONCAT (author_fname, '!!!') FROM BOOKS;
        SELECT CONCAT (author_fname,' ', author_lname) AS fullnames from books;

        Concat with separator
            SELECT CONCAT_WS (' ', author_fname, author_lname) AS fullnames from books;

Substring
    Two ways to use SUBSTRING:
        SUBSTRING()
        SUBSTR()

    Work with part of strings
    Extract 5 characters from a string, starting in position 1:
        SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5)

    The first value comes from the table or string provided, 
        the second value is the starting position
            SELECT SUBSTRING(author_fname, 4) from books;

            SELECT SUBSTR(author_fname, 1,1), author_lname, title from books;

            SELECT CONCAT
            (
                SUBSTRING(title, 1, 10),
                '...'
            ) AS 'short title'
            FROM books;

    You can use a negative number as start point as well 

Replace
    Replace parts of string
    REPLACE(start, from, to)

    REPLACE(hello world, hell, !@#$%)
    output: !@#$%o world

    The REPLACE() function in SQL is used to modify data in a specific query result or expression, 
        but it doesn't directly modify the data in the underlying table.

Reverse
    It does reverse the string
    SELECT Reverse()

Char_length
    MySQL has separate CHAR_LENGTH() and LENGTH() functions. 
    CHAR_LENGTH() returns the length of the string in characters,
    while LENGTH() in MySQL returns the length of the string in bytes. 
    
    This can make a difference if your string includes multibyte characters (like UTF-8). 
    In such scenarios, itâ€™s always recommended to be sure how your specific 
    SQL system implements LENGTH function.

    MySQL use CHAR_LENGTH otherwise, use LENGTH
    SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('Hello World');

Upper
    it is used to convert all letters in a specified string to uppercase.
    SELECT UPPER('Hello World');

Lower
    used to return all uppercase character(s) in a string to lowercase.
    SELECT LOWER('Hello World');

TRIM
    removes leading and trailing spaces of a string. You can also remove other specified characters.
    SELECT TRIM('  Hello  ');
