Next examples are following the fields from the .sql file attached

Concat
    Combine data for cleaner output
        SELECT CONCAT('h', 'e','l', 'l','o');
        SELECT CONCAT (author_fname, '!!!') FROM BOOKS;
        SELECT CONCAT (author_fname,' ', author_lname) AS fullnames from books;

        Concat with separator
            SELECT CONCAT_WS (' ', author_fname, author_lname) AS fullnames from books;

Substring
    Two ways to use SUBSTRING:
        SUBSTRING()
        SUBSTR()

    Work with part of strings
    Extract 5 characters from a string, starting in position 1:
        SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5)

    The first value comes from the table or string provided, 
        the second value is the starting position
            SELECT SUBSTRING(author_fname, 4) from books;

            SELECT SUBSTR(author_fname, 1,1), author_lname, title from books;

            SELECT CONCAT
            (
                SUBSTRING(title, 1, 10),
                '...'
            ) AS 'short title'
            FROM books;

    You can use a negative number as start point as well
