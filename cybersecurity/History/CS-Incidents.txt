Cybersecurity Incidents
    Cybersecurity incidents are events or occurrences that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of 
    digital information or systems. These incidents can be caused by intentional or accidental actions, and they can have 
    serious consequences, such as data breaches, theft of intellectual property, disruption of critical infrastructure, or financial loss.

    ~Malware attacks: Malware is software designed to infiltrate or damage computer systems without the owner's knowledge or consent. 
        Malware can be used to steal data, hijack computers for criminal purposes, or disrupt operations.

    ~Phishing scams: Phishing is the practice of using social engineering to trick people into giving away sensitive information, 
        such as passwords or credit card numbers. Phishing attacks can be carried out via email, phone calls, or text messages.

    ~Ransomware attacks: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands payment in exchange 
        for the decryption key. Ransomware attacks can be extremely costly and disruptive, especially for businesses.

    ~Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks: DDoS attacks flood a website or network with traffic to the point of 
        overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to users. DDoS attacks can be used to extort money or disrupt services.

    ~Insider threats: Insider threats are incidents where an employee or contractor of an organization intentionally or 
        unintentionally causes harm to the organization's digital assets. This can include stealing data, i
        ntroducing malware, or causing system disruptions.
    
    ~Denail of service attacks: involve overwhelming computer systems or networks with traffic, causing them to become unavailable. 
        These attacks can result in the disruption of critical services or the loss of data.
    
    ~Advanced persistent threats (APTs): APTs are complex and targeted attacks that are designed to compromise a specific target, 
        often over an extended period of time. APTs can be difficult to detect and can result in the theft of sensitive 
        information or other forms of harm.

    ~Social engineering attacks: Social engineering attacks involve the use of psychological manipulation to trick 
        individuals into divulging sensitive information or taking other actions that are harmful to themselves or 
        their organization. These attacks can take many forms, including phishing and spear phishing.

    ~Internet of Things (IoT) attacks: IoT devices, such as smart home devices, medical devices, and industrial 
        control systems, can be vulnerable to cyber attacks. These attacks can result in the compromise of 
        critical infrastructure or personal data.

    ~Supply chain attacks: Supply chain attacks involve the compromise of a third-party vendor or supplier 
        that is used by an organization. These attacks can be difficult to detect and can result in the 
        compromise of sensitive data

Historical Incidents

    Clipper chip development:
            The Clipper chip was a controversial encryption device developed by the U.S. government in the 1990s. 
            Its development was motivated by concerns that strong encryption technologies were making it difficult for 
            law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access communications between criminals and terrorists.

            The Clipper chip was designed to be a hardware encryption device that would allow users to encrypt their communications, 
            but would also include a "backdoor" that would allow government agencies to decrypt the communications when necessary. 
            The backdoor would be accessible only with a unique key held by the government, which would only be used with a warrant or court order.

            The Clipper chip faced significant opposition from civil liberties groups, who argued that it would undermine privacy
            and security by providing a means for government surveillance of private communications. Critics also argued that 
            the backdoor would be vulnerable to exploitation by hackers or foreign intelligence agencies, potentially compromising national security.

            Ultimately, the Clipper chip was not widely adopted and was eventually abandoned by the U.S. government. 
            The controversy surrounding its development contributed to the development of strong encryption technologies 
            that are now widely used for secure communications.

    MoonLight Maze
            Moonlight Maze was a 1999 US government investigation into a massive data breach of classified information. 
            It started in 1996 and affected NASA, the Pentagon, military contractors, civilian academics, the DOE, 
            and numerous other American government agencies. By the end of 1999, the Moonlight Maze task force was composed 
            of forty specialists from law enforcement, military, and government. The investigators claimed that if all 
            the information stolen was printed out and stacked, it would be three times the height of the Washington Monument, 
            which is 555 ft (169 m) tall.[3][4] The Russian government was blamed for the attacks, although there was initially 
            little hard evidence to back up the US accusations besides a Russian IP address that was traced to the hack. 
            Moonlight Maze represents one of the first widely known cyber espionage campaigns in world history. 
            It was even classified as an Advanced Persistent Threat (a very serious designation for stealthy computer 
            network threat actors, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group) after two years of constant assault. 
            Although Moonlight Maze was regarded as an isolated attack for many years, unrelated investigations revealed that 
            the threat actor involved in the attack continued to be active and employ similar methods until as recently as 2016.

            The hack began with the hackers building "back doors" through which they could re-enter the infiltrated systems at 
            will and steal further data; they also left behind tools that reroute specific network traffic through Russia. 
            Everything they exploited during the attacks came from publicly available resources, not their own creation. 
            In most cases, the exploits were discovered by system administrators with the intention of informing others of 
            the vulnerabilities present in their own systems, but were instead manipulated for malicious purposes.
            The hackers found success since software manufacturers and maintainers were not vigilant about making sure there 
            were no flaws in their systems. They would leave known vulnerabilities unpatched for long periods of time, 
            sometimes as long as six months to a year, neglecting any security patch cycles. This was because prior to 
            Moonlight Maze, no-one was aware of the damage that could be done through cyber attacks since the internet 
            was still relatively new. As a result, they were extremely vulnerable and not very difficult to infiltrate, 
            resulting in one of the largest data breaches of classified information in history. In order to conceal their 
            location and throw off investigators, the hackers relayed their connection through various vulnerable institutions 
            like universities, libraries, and more since the servers they hacked could only see the last location they routed 
            through (called proxying).

    Solar sunrise:
            Solar Sunrise was a computer hacking incident that targeted US military and government computer networks in 1998. 
            The incident was carried out by a group of hackers, including two American teenagers and an Israeli hacker.

            The attack was launched through a common vulnerability in the Solaris operating system, which was used on many of
            the targeted computer systems. The attackers were able to gain access to the systems by exploiting a known 
            security flaw in the login process of the Solaris operating system.

            Once inside the systems, the attackers installed a variety of tools and backdoors, which allowed them to maintain 
            persistent access and continue to exfiltrate data over a period of several weeks. The attackers were able to 
            obtain access to both unclassified and classified data, including email messages and technical documents.

            The incident was discovered by a computer analyst at the Department of Defense, who noticed suspicious activity 
            on the network. The analyst raised the alarm, and an investigation was launched. 
            The investigation ultimately led to the arrest and prosecution of the two American teenagers and the Israeli hacker.

    Operation Buckshoot Yankee:
            In 2008, the United States Department of Defense was infected with malware. Described at the time as the 
            "worst breach of U.S. military computers in history", the defense against the attack was named "Operation Buckshot Yankee". 
            It led to the creation of the United States Cyber Command.

            It started when a USB flash drive infected by a foreign intelligence agency was left in the parking lot of a 
            Department of Defense facility at a base in the Middle East. It contained malicious code and was put 
            into a USB port from a laptop computer that was attached to United States Central Command. 
            From there it spread undetected to other systems, both classified and unclassified.

            The campaign that Buckshot Yankee targeted was carried out by a Chinese hacking group known as Titan Rain. 
            The group had been targeting US military and government computer networks for several years, stealing sensitive 
            information and data. The campaign was considered a serious threat to US national security.

            As part of Operation Buckshot Yankee, the US military and intelligence agencies conducted a number of activities 
            to identify and neutralize the threat posed by Titan Rain. These activities included monitoring the group's activities, 
            analyzing the group's tactics and techniques, and developing countermeasures to prevent future attacks.

            The operation was successful in identifying and disrupting the Titan Rain campaign, and several individuals believed 
            to be associated with the group were arrested in China. However, it is believed that the group continued to operate and 
            launch cyber attacks against US targets.

Cybersecurity Today

    The cybersecurity field is rapidly growing. Companies are learning that they need to ramp up their security 
        defenses against cybercriminals. With the workforce transitioning to more remote positions, and with the 
        ise of cryptocurrency, a few trends are taking place

        Cryptocurrencies will be subject to strict regulation.

        Social media organizations will become stricter about how users share information.

        Remote workers will continue to be targets for cybercriminals.

        The cybersecurity skills gap will escalate as more jobs go unfilled.

        Internet of Things (IoT) devices will become more vulnerable to cyberattacks.

    Still not convinced of the need for cybersecurity? Here are a few statistics to astonish you:

        Human error causes 95% of cybersecurity breaches (Mee and Brandenburg, 2020).

        In 2020, the US was the target of 46% of all cyberattacks—more than double that of any other country (Lambert, 2021).

        Of all the cyber breaches, 43% are insider threats—either intentional or unintentional (Check Point, 2022).

        In 2021, data breaches exposed 22 billion records (Risk Based Security, 2022).

        In 2021, about 40% of breaches involved phishing, 11% involved malware, and 22% involved hacking (Verizon, 2021).

        In 2021, 1,862 data breaches were recorded—surpassing the 2017 record of 1,506 breaches (Fowler, 2022).
    
    Cyber War
        Today, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Cyber war is a concern because it causes harm that's 
        comparable to that of physical warfare. It does so by using technology to "disrupt the activities of a state 
        or organization, especially the deliberate attacking of information systems for strategic or military purposes". 
        Seven types of cyber war attacks exist: 

            Espionage

            Sabotage

            Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

            Electrical power grid attacks

            Propaganda attacks

            Economic disruption

            Surprise attacks (Imperva, 2022)

            We combat cyber war through risk assessments, layered defenses, and the securing of the private sector.

    The Business of Cybercrime
        Today, cybercrime can almost be considered a business. While many factors motivate cybercriminals, 
        the main one is money. In fact, according to a 2018 Bromium report by Dr. Michael McGuire, cybercriminals 
        generate at least $1.5 trillion per year (Polk, 2021). And, that's where you come in! Cybersecurity 
        professionals deal with this issue in several ways:

            Using a continual process: Security is lifelong and not done once. To succeed in an organization, 
                cybersecurity must be considered a continual process. Small companies might think that they're 
                too small to be attacked, but that's not the case.

            Conducting security evaluations: Companies need to evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential 
                cyberattacks. This includes determining how easy of a target their systems are—and considering 
                and observing what would happen if they were compromised. Lots of hidden risks can remain unnoticed. 
                For example, the famous Target credit card breach occurred because of a heating, ventilating, 
                and air-conditioning (HVAC) vendor that shared the credit-card processing network   .

            Establishing priority: By multiplying the likelihood and impact, companies can establish priority. 
                They can then change or update their systems as needed.

            Having a security first mindset: Because cybercrime is such a massive business, a company needs to 
                share its security responsibility across all its employees to succeed.

    Current Events

        Stuxnet worm
            The Stuxnet worm is a highly sophisticated computer virus that was designed to target and disrupt Iran's nuclear program. 
            It was first discovered in 2010 and is believed to have been created by a joint operation between the United States and Israel.

            The Stuxnet worm was unique in that it was designed to specifically target programmable logic controllers (PLCs), 
            which are the devices that control industrial processes such as those used in nuclear facilities. Once the worm infected a PLC, 
            it could cause it to malfunction or behave in unexpected ways, which could potentially cause serious damage or even a catastrophic failure.

            The Stuxnet worm was also designed to be highly stealthy, using a number of advanced techniques to avoid detection and spread throughout 
            a network. It was able to exploit several zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and other software, 
            which allowed it to spread rapidly and infect a large number of systems.

            The Stuxnet worm is widely considered to be one of the most sophisticated and complex pieces of malware ever created. 
            Its development required a significant amount of time, resources, and expertise, and it represented a major shift 
            in the way that cyber warfare was conducted.
        
        SolarWinds hack
            The SolarWinds hack was a supply chain attack, which means that the attackers were able to gain access to their targets 
            by compromising a trusted third-party vendor. In this case, the attackers were able to inject malicious code into a software 
            update for the SolarWinds Orion platform, which is widely used by many organizations for network and IT management.

            Once the malicious code was installed on a target's system, it was able to give the attackers remote access and control 
            of the system. This allowed the attackers to steal sensitive data, manipulate systems, and conduct further attacks.

            The SolarWinds hack was a highly sophisticated and complex attack, and it demonstrated the capabilities of 
            state-sponsored hackers to carry out long-term, covert cyber operations. The attack also highlighted the vulnerability 
            of supply chain attacks, which can be difficult to detect and can compromise multiple organizations through a 
            single point of compromise.

        Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack
            The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack was a cyber attack that occurred in May 2021 and affected one of the largest fuel 
            pipelines in the United States. The attack was carried out by a cybercriminal group known as DarkSide, 
            which is believed to be based in Eastern Europe.

            The attack began with the use of a type of malware called ransomware, which was used to encrypt the company's data and 
            demand a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. The attackers were able to gain access to Colonial Pipeline's 
            systems through a compromised VPN account, which was not protected by multi-factor authentication.

            The attack resulted in the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, which transports gasoline and other fuels from 
            refineries in the Gulf Coast to markets in the eastern United States. The shutdown caused widespread fuel 
            shortages and panic buying in many parts of the country, and it also had significant economic impacts.

            In response to the attack, Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom of $4.4 million in bitcoin to the attackers. 
            While the company was able to recover the decryption key and restore its systems, the attack highlighted 
            the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to cyber attacks and the potentially devastating 
            consequences that such attacks can have.

        The Log4j vulnerability 
            also known as CVE-2021-44228, is a critical vulnerability in the widely used Apache Log4j logging library, 
            which is used by many applications and systems to log information. The vulnerability was discovered in 
            December 2021 and has been described as one of the most serious vulnerabilities in recent years due to its 
            potential impact on a wide range of systems and applications.

            The Log4j vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability, which means that an attacker can exploit 
            it to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or application. The vulnerability is particularly 
            dangerous because it can be exploited through a simple and common attack vector, by sending a specially 
            crafted log message to a vulnerable system or application.

            The Log4j vulnerability has already been exploited by threat actors in the wild, and it has been used to 
            carry out a wide range of attacks, including the deployment of ransomware and other types of malware, 
            the theft of sensitive data, and the hijacking of systems for use in botnets.

        Microsoft Exchange Y2K22 bug
            The Microsoft Exchange Y2K22 bug is a recently discovered bug that affects certain versions of Microsoft Exchange Server. 
            The bug is related to the way that the software handles dates and time, and it is similar to the Y2K (Year 2000) 
            bug that caused widespread concerns leading up to the turn of the millennium.

            The Microsoft Exchange Y2K22 bug is caused by a limitation in the way that the software calculates dates, which means 
            that it is unable to correctly process certain dates after December 31, 2021. This can cause various issues, 
            such as incorrect time stamps, email delivery failures, and problems with meeting invitations and other scheduling features.
