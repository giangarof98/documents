Introduction
    The goal of this bootcamp is to ensure that you understand cyber technologies in order to protect their infrastructure. 
        To do so, you need to first understand the history of cybersecurity and how we got to where we are today. Furthermore, 
        cybersecurity is always evolving along with technology. 
        So, it's important that you become a lifelong learner to succeed as a cybersecurity professional.

    1960s
        The history of cybersecurity begins well before today's age of cell phones and wearable devices. 
        In the 1960s, an experimental computer network, named Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), was created . 
        The purpose was to let Pentagon labs share data and research through the network to military personnel in the Cold War 
        (Featherly, 2016). The idea was that no headquarters or base of operations would exist that could be attacked and destroyed. 
        ARPANET served as a prelude to the Internet. Today, the Internet retains a similar structure but on a larger scale.

    1980s
        Surprisingly, the first public policy related to cybersecurity was created in the early 1980s. 
        At that time, the first laptops had barely begun distribution, and public Internet providers didn't yet exist. 
        So, what caused this policy to be created? The answer is a movie named WarGames. This movie, which debuted in 1983, 
        is about a teenager who hacks into the computer of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and nearly starts World War III. 
        President Ronald Reagan attended this movie. Then, during a meeting, Reagan asked General John W. Vessey if that could happen in real life. 
        The general determined that it could and might even be worse than what the movie depicted. So after only 15 months, 
        Reagan signed the NSDD-145 classified national security decision directive, named National Policy on Telecommunications 
        and Automated Information Systems Security (Kaplan, 2016).

        At first, the public didn't accept NSDD-145. It allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) to secure all the 
        computer servers and networks in the United States. This began discussions of concern related to security 
        and privacy on the Internet—a debate that still exists today.

    1990s
        In the 1990s, the Internet took off. And along with it, do did the cybersecurity industry. 
        Virus risks increased, and companies developed antivirus programs. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was created to 
        protect activities like online purchases. In fact, that was the foundation for the development of 
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)—the secure version of HTTP (Education Dynamics, 2022).

    2000s
        The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 spurred conversations about how to avoid the next cyber threat. 
        Since then, governments have weaponized vulnerabilities, and criminals have exploited them. This is an ever-growing 
        problem because of the increase in our reliance on technology.

        The 2000s also brought the first hacker group, named Anonymous. And, credit card hacks took off through data breaches.
        This created the need to focus on information security throughout various sectors, including retail.
