-Bash Scriptt

    A Bash script is a script written in the Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) language, 
        which is a Unix/Linux shell that provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system.

        Bash scripts are used to automate tasks, run commands, 
        and perform system administration tasks in Linux/Unix-based systems.

        A Bash script is a plain text file that contains a series of commands, 
        statements, and functions that are executed in sequence by the Bash interpreter. 
        The script can also accept input from the user or arguments passed to it on the command line.

        Line 1: #!/bin/bash
        Line 2: # This line is a comment and will not be executed.
        Line 3: target_dir="/home/fstack"
        Line 4: echo "Directory Listing of: $target_dir"
        Line 5: ls -l $target_dir

        Line 1 (shebang): The shebang is a has (#) and a bang (!) combined. 
            This must be on the very first line with no spaces before it. 
            The shebang tells the interactive shell that this script should be interpreted as bash commands.
        Line 2: Any line that begins with a "#" is a comment and will not be executed. Comments are used to explain sections of code.
        Line 3: This is the assignment of a variable called target_dir. 
            Notice there are no spaces around the "=". It is a good idea to enclose the value 
            of your variable with quotes, especially if you have a space or special character in the variable.
        Line 4: This line is using echo to output text to the user. This is similar to a 
            print statement in other languages. Notice the "$" in front of target_dir. This is required when using a variable. 
        Line 5: This is a simple long listing command. Notice the use of the target_dir variable again.
