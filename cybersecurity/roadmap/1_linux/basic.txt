Path:
    Absolute path: Exact location of a path or directory
    Relative path Specify the file location relative to the current directory
        Relative paths are useful when moving files or folders around the file system, 
        as they can be more easily modified without breaking the path. However, absolute paths are 
        necessary when referring to files or folders in other parts of the file system, 
        or when a program requires an absolute path to function properly.

-Commands
    The top level of the Linux file system is the / directory, called ‘root’. Every other file and directory is contained within this directory.

    cat         short of concatenate. read the file content. only on small files.
    More        work better on large files. 
    less        display the file content one screen at a time. work better on large files.
    tail        preview a file's end.
    head        preview a file's beginning.
    Sort        Alphabetically sort a file.

    Grep        Search a file for a specific string of text and return any lines it appears on
                Dig through files and return only the pieces that we want
                Grep is pretty simple to use. You start with grep, then follow it with the word you would like 
                    to search for, and then end it with the file you would like to search in.

    Locate      Search command that looks into a pre-made database of filenames and outputs results.
                Is faster and more efficient when searching for files that have been recently added or changed, 
                but it may not find files that were added since the last update of the database. 
    Find        search command that will search for specific search terms in filenames.
    updatedb    Update the locate command's internal database. 

    wc
        word count
        wc -l front_desk.log network_closet.log server_room.log | sort -nr

        wc counts the number of lines, words and bytes

    man 
        manual

    awk         Search a file colomn by column and return specific text.

                Example: awk -F’:’ ‘{ print $1 $3 }’ somefile.txt

                    awk 
                        The command we are invoking
                    -F’:’ 
                        Designate the format of the column breaks. Here we are saying make a 
                        column break at each ‘:’. If you leave this part out, awk will break 
                        on whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc).
                    ‘{ print $1 $3 }’ 
                        What do we want to do with these columns? In this example, we are printing 
                        the first and third columns. You could print more or even include strings 
                        like this: ‘{ print $1.$2“@somedomain.com”}’. 
                        This might be used to build a list of email addresses. 
                        You can also use $NR to return the last column. There is much more 
                        we can do in this space. We will get more advanced later.
                    somefile.txt 
                        Where is awk going to get its data? In this example, it will look in somefile.txt.



    pipe |      Used to send the output of one command to the input of the next command.
                The | or pipe character is very useful in bash. It will take the output of 
                a command and send it to the input of the next command. 
                Use it to string multiple commands into what we call a "one-liner". 
                Security professionals use grep, awk, and pipe characters to search for 
                and pull interesting data out of files. 

    uniq        Take a sorted list and output all of the unique entries. Works with an input already sorted


-Graphic User Interfice & terminal

    GUI: Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora, etc 

    Terminal Terminology:
        $: Default promt sign. Indicated for non root users
        #: Roor user/super user.

        Terminal: text based interface to write Commands.
        CLI: method of interacting with the system or program through that interface.
        Shell: program that procesess commands and output the results. Command line interpreter.

    But received a 404 "file not found" response of only 196 bytes


Data Stream

    Every time you run a command in Linux, three data streams are created. They are:

        stdin or 0 (standard input) - This is where text that is input by the user (or another command) is handled.
        stdout or 1 (standard output) - Output from a command is written here.
        stderr or 2 (standard error) - If any errors are encountered, they are written here. 
            The text will show up on the command line just like stdout, but the actual output is treated separately.
