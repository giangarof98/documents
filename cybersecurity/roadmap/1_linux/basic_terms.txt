-Path:
    Absolute path: Exact location of a path or directory
    Relative path Specify the file location relative to the current directory
        Relative paths are useful when moving files or folders around the file system, 
        as they can be more easily modified without breaking the path. However, absolute paths are 
        necessary when referring to files or folders in other parts of the file system, 
        or when a program requires an absolute path to function properly.

-Data Stream

    Every time you run a command in Linux, three data streams are created. They are:

        stdin or 0 (standard input) - This is where text that is input by the user (or another command) is handled.
        stdout or 1 (standard output) - Output from a command is written here.
        stderr or 2 (standard error) - If any errors are encountered, they are written here. 
            The text will show up on the command line just like stdout, but the actual output is treated separately.
