Archiving Files

    zip and gzip are not uncommon in the Linux world, but the king of archiving and 
        compression is definitely tar. The tar command is a really old Linux utility 
        that takes its name from "Tape ARchive". An actual tape archive is getting rarer 
        and rarer these days, but the use of the tar command is still going strong. 
        Tar takes some getting used to, but once you master it, you will never want to go back.

        Archives created with tar are called tarballs and use the extension .tar. 
        Tar is an archiving tool that collects files together to produce one file; 
        on its own does not compress these files. However, we can use compression 
        algorithms with the tar command to create a smaller file size.

        Commands
            cf: Compress a file
            xf: Extract a file

            -cf: No compression
            -czf: gzip compression
            -cjf: bzip2 compression
            -cJf: xz compression

Reading File permissions

    -rwxr-x--- 1 root adm 71 Apr 1 12:04 access.log

        The first character (-): Either a - for files or a d for directory. 
            From this, we can see that the access.log is a file. 
        
        The owner (root): Has permission to read, write, and execute this file.

        Group (adm): Anyone in this group is allowed to read and execute this file, 
            but cannot write to it.

        Permissions (---): Permissions for anyone who is not root and is not in the adm group. 
            In this case, they have zero permissions. They are not allowed to interact with this file.


    Change owner file and group name
        sudo chmod <owner name>:<group name> <filename>   
    Change group name
        sudo chmod :<group name> <filename>
    Change user owner
        sudo chmod <owner name> <filename>
