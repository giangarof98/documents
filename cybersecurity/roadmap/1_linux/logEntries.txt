Log entries

    Log file is a running history of events on your machine.
    Arguably one of the most important logs on a Linux system is the syslog.
    It is a busy log file that is constantly having events written to it by various systems and services. 
    Some services have their own specialized log files.
    An example of that would be the apache webserver.

    Log files are all a little bit different, but they almost always start each line with a timestamp.
    This makes it easier to read the history of a service chronologically. It also makes it easier to zero in on an exact point in time.
    This could be valuable if you know that a malicious actor attacked at a certain time.
    You could then sift through the logs around that timestamp and look for clues.

    A modern Linux system produces a LOT of log entries.
    These log files can be invaluable to a cybersecurity or IT professional, 
        but part of the battle is knowing what log holds the information you need.
    Take a look in the /var/log directory and you will see so many types of log files that your head will spin.
    These files are the most commonly used logs in a cybersecurity context:

        syslog:             catch-all logs for system events
        authlog:            logs anytime a user enters a password to log in or elevate privileges
        dpkg.log:           keep a list of the time and name of all packages installed on the system
        apache:             webserver logs
        vsftpf:             ftp server logs
        mysql or mariadb:   database server logs

            HTTP    hyper text transfer protocol
            ftp     file transfer protocol
