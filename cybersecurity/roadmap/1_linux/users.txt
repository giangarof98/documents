A Closer Look: Files and Users

    /etc/passwd
    The /etc/passwd file holds a list of all users on the system. Here is an example line:
        root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
        fstack:x:1000:2000:Full Stack, , , :/home/fstack:/bin/bash

        Login name (fstack)
            The account name used when logging in
        Optional encrypted password (x)
            Not used anymore
        Numerical user ID (1000)
            The number given to a user account (1002, 1002, etc.)
        Numerical group ID (2000)
            The number assigned to the user's primary group. Usually, this group has the same name as their login.
        User name or comment field (Full Stack, , , )
            Where you type a person's actual name
        User home directory (/home/fstack)
            Normally /home/<login name>, but not always
        Optional user command interpreter (/bin/bash)
            For most users this is set to /bin/bash, but can also be set to another shell (like /bin/sh) 
            or could also be /bin/false, /bin/nologin to lock out users
        

    /etc/shadow
        The /etc/shadow file holds password information for users. Here is an example line:Ã¥
        fstack:$1$x13tRK6O$UXVzwbTh6C7/WiE1W7k1f.:19047:0:99999:7:::

        Login name (fstack)
            The name of the user

        Hashed password ($1$x13tRK6O$UXVzwbTh6C7/WiE1W7k1f.)
            If the user has a *, then it has never had a password. 
            If it has a ! or ! !, then the account is locked. 
            The first few characters tell you what type of hash it is.

        Date of last password change (19047)
            The number of days since epoch (Jan 1, 1970) since that last change of password

        Minimum password age (0)
            The number of days old a password must be before it can be changed

        Maximum password age (99999)
            The number of days before a password expires

        Password warning period (7)
            The number of days before expiration that the OS will warn you to change your password

        Account expiration date
            The number of days since epoch (Jan 1, 1970) until an account expires and becomes unusable)

    
    UID
        The UID is a specific number that Linux assigns to each user for identification purposes.

        The root user always has the UID of 0.

        Standard users, i.e., users who are real people, have UIDs greater than 1000.

        System users, i.e., automated users designed to complete system tasks, 
        generally have UIDs less than 1000.
