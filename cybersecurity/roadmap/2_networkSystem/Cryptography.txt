Symmetric encryption 
    It means that the same key can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.
Asymmetric Encryption
    Modern web security, however, is built on asymmetric encryption. 
    Asymmetric encryption uses one key for encrypting and another key for decrypting.
    Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption but is also more computationally expensive, 
    meaning it takes more resources to encrypt/decrypt.

Digital Certificates
    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) - TLS (Transport Layer Security)
        Cryptographic protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.
        TLS is the newer and more secure version of SSL and is currently the standard protocol used to secure web traffic.
