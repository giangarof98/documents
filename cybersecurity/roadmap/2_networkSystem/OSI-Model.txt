At its most basic, a message sent through a network is nothing more than a series of bits encoded 
into electrical pulses, radio waves, or bursts of light. 

The process that converts a web page down to those pulses and then re-assembles them on the other side happens in layers. 

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model is a popular way to describe these layers. 

The top of the OSI model is layer 7, where you might be using a web browser to interact with a website.

Layer 1 is the bottom layer where the stream of bits is being sent through copper wires, fiber optic cables, or radio waves.

Because this unit is an introduction to networking, we will spend the bulk of our time discussing layers 2-4.



Number              7
Layer Name          Application
Description         The part of an application that interacts with the network stack
Example             A web serverâ€™s network process receives a request for an image and responds.

Number              6
Layer Name          Presentation
Description         Encryption/encoding to decryption/decoding
Example             The image is encoded into base64 before being sent out.

Number              5
Layer Name          Session
Description         Keeps track of which hosts we are communicating with
Example             The web server uses the session data to determine which host will receive the file.

Number              4
Layer Name          Transport
Description         Where the data is broken up into packets and turned into a stream
Example             The file is broken up into a series of packets.

Number              3
Layer Name          Network
Description         IP addressing and routing
Example             The chunks are inserted into a series of packets that includes IP addressing information and sent to the nearest gateway (a router). 
                    This information is used to traverse the Internet.

Number              2
Layer Name          Datalink
Description         MAC addresses and switching
Example             The IP address from layer 3 is enough to get the packets to the correct LAN. 
                    A MAC is then used by the networking gear to deliver to the correct machine.

Number              1
Layer Name          Physical 
Description         Sends and receives bits
Example             The frames are transmitted as bits to the Network Interface Card (NIC) on your machine.
