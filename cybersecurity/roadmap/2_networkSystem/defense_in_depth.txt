Defense in depth is a cybersecurity strategy that involves implementing multiple layers of 
    security controls to protect against various types of attacks. 
The idea behind this strategy is that if one layer of defense fails, there are still 
    other layers in place to prevent an attacker from gaining access to sensitive data or systems.

    Perimeter security: (Edge firewall)
        This is the first layer of defense that is designed to keep unauthorized users from accessing a network or system. 
        Perimeter security measures might include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, 
        and access control mechanisms.

    Network security: (Network segmentation)
        This layer is focused on protecting the network itself, and might include measures like segmentation, 
        traffic monitoring and analysis, and encryption.

    Host security: 
        Host security involves protecting individual devices or servers from attack, and might include 
        measures like antivirus software, patch management, and application whitelisting.

    Application security: 
        This layer focuses on protecting the applications themselves, and might include measures 
        like code reviews, input validation, and penetration testing.

    Data security: 
        Finally, data security measures are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure. 
        This might include measures like encryption, access controls, and data backup and recovery.
