Wireshark
    Is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection,
    such as from your computer to your home office or the internet.

    You can capture packets that are sent and received on your network interface and analyze them at the packet level. 
    It allows you to filter and search for specific packets based on various criteria, 
        such as IP address, port number, protocol, and packet type.

    What Wireshar does:
        Packet capture
        Filtering
        Visualization
