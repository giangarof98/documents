    Exam details
        The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam consists of 65 questions to be completed in 90 minutes. 
        The minimum passing score is 70%.

        Two types of questions are included on the exam: multiple choice and multiple response.
            A multiple-choice question has one correct response and three incorrect responses, or distractors.
            A multiple-response question has two or more correct responses out of five or more options.

        Exam domains
            The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam includes four domains:
            Cloud Concepts
            Security and Compliance
            Technology
            Billing and Pricing
    
    The areas covered describe each domain in the Exam Guide for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.
    You are encouraged to read the information in the Exam Guide as part of your preparation for the exam.
    Each domain in the exam is weighted. 
    The weight represents the percentage of questions in the exam that correspond to that particular domain. 
    These are approximations, so the questions on your exam may not match these percentages exactly. 
    The exam does not indicate the domain associated with a question. 
    In fact, some questions can potentially fall under multiple domains.
