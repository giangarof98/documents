Workgroups vs Domanins

    Workgroups
        A workgroup is a collection of Windows systems with its own set of users and permissions.
        Each system has a set of users and passwords (stored in a SAM file).
        These users have a set of privileges and permissions that apply locally. 
        You can create a user who has administrative capabilities and a user who has minimal privileges
        If you have the same username on multiple computers, you can log on to multiple computers by using the same local username.

        The default local Administrator account is a user account for the system administrator.
        Every Windows operating system has an Administrator account (SID S-1-5-domain-500, with a display name of Administrator).
        The Administrator account is the first account that gets created during the Windows installation.
        The Administrator account can create other local users, assign user rights, and assign permissions
        Note that the default Administrator account cannot be deleted or locked out but can be renamed or disabled.
