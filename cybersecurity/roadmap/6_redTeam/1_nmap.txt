Nmap Scanning
    What is a port ?
        A port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and 
        to direct data to a specific service. At the software level, within an operating system, 
        a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.
    
    Short for Network Mapper
    It was initially developed by Gordon Lyon

    Nmap is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing.
    It's used to scan networks.
    Targets to scan can be supplied by hostname, IP address, or CIDR on the command line.

    Syntax:
        nmap [Scan Type] [Options] [Target(s)]

        nmap -p-   [Target]                         all ports
        nmap -sV   [Target]                         service scan
        nmap -sC   [Target]                         run default nmap script located at /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
        nmap -sV   [Target]                         Determine the version service running on port

    Nmap scan types:
        Ping Sweep
            performed with the -sn option.
            It is used to find what systems are alive on a network.
            A ping sweep sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) requests to scanned systems and 
                checks for responses from those systems.
            Just because a system does not respond to ICMP requests does not mean it is not alive.

        Port Scan
            Performed by default.
            Specify which ports to scan using the -p option.
            This is used to check for open ports on a system.
            Open ports identify some services running on the system
            Standard ports you will see during scans:
                20/21 - FTP, file transfer server, used to host files
                22 - SSH server, used to log into the server
                25 - SMTP server, used to send email
                53 - DNS server, used for domain name resolution
                80 - Web server used for HTTP
                443 - Web server used for HTTPS
                445 - SMB server, used by Windows systems or Samba servers

        Service Scan 
            Performed with the -sV option.
            It identifies the particular version of the service running on the port,
    
    Nmap also comes with the Nmap scripting engine,
    allowing Nmap to run more customized scans. 

    /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory is where the Nmap scripts are located in the Kali Linux by default



What measures can be taken to make service detection more difficult for attackers?
    Firewall Configuration
    Port Restriction
    Service Banner Customization
    Network Segmentation
    Non-Standard Port Usage
    Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
    Rate Limiting
    Regular Patching and Updates
    Security Monitoring and Logging
