Reconnaissance
    Reconnaissance is a preliminary survey to gain information about a target.
    It is the most important part of any offensive security engagement,
        as it allows you to better understand your target. 
    Reconnaissance is done in two approaches â€“ passive and active.

Passive reconnaissance
    Involves gaining information about your target without directly interacting with it.
    using Shodan to see information about the target.

    The main benefit of passive reconnaissance is that it does not 
        let the target know they are being scoped.
    
    There are several open source intelligence (OSINT) tools 
        that can be used for this as well, e.g. Shodan, theHarvester, etc.

Active reconnaissance
    Involves gaining information about your target by directly interacting with it.
    The main benefit of active reconnaissance is that it allows you to see 
        exactly what the target has

    However, you are making noise on their network and risk letting 
        the target know that they are being scanned,
        which could cause the target to become warier of future 
        attacks and increase their monitoring and defenses.
