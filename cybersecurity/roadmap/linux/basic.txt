    Absolute path: Exact location of a path or directory
    Relative path Specify the file location relative to the current directory

        Relative paths are useful when moving files or folders around the file system, 
        as they can be more easily modified without breaking the path. However, absolute paths are 
        necessary when referring to files or folders in other parts of the file system, 
        or when a program requires an absolute path to function properly.
