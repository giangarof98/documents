Symmetric encryption 
    It means that the same key can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.
Asymmetric Encryption
    Modern web security, however, is built on asymmetric encryption. 
    Asymmetric encryption uses one key for encrypting and another key for decrypting.
    Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption but is also more computationally expensive, 
    meaning it takes more resources to encrypt/decrypt.
