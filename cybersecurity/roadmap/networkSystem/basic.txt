IP          Internet Protocol
            
MAC         Media Access Control
            sometimes referred to as a hardware or physical address, is a unique, 
            12-character alphanumeric attribute that is used to identify individual electronic devices on a network. 
            An example of a MAC address is: 00-B0-D0-63-C2-26.

LAN         Local Area Network
            Is a network confined to a small, localized area. Home WiFi networks and small business networks are common examples of LANs.

WAN         Wide Area Network
            Is a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances.
            Setting up a WAN allows your LANs to share resources safely and efficiently.
            It also allows you to set up another line of defense between your users and the Internet.

            Technically, any large network that spreads out over a wide geographic area is a WAN. 
            The Internet itself is considered a WAN.
            each office typically has its own local area network, or LAN, and these LANs connect via a WAN. 
            These long connections may be formed in several different ways, including leased lines, VPNs, or IP tunnels

VPN         Virtual Private Network
            Is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. 
            The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted.
            Any traffic you wish to keep confidential crossing the internet should use a VPN
            common reasons to use it include privacy, protection, and anonymity. 

ISP         Internet Service Provider


            A router passes traffic between two networks. A switch only handles traffic inside of its own LAN.

Node        endpoints on the network.
            Devices on a network are called nodes.
            the connection point among network devices such as routers, printers, or switches that can receive 
            and send data from one endpoint to the other.

Network Models  

            Peer-to-Peer:
                Peer-to-peer: can share files or other resources with any other peer. 
                These are usually set up as an ad-hoc way to share files, printers, databases, etc., between two devices.

            Client-server:
                one host (the server) makes resources available to other hosts (the clients). 
                A client will request resources from the server. The server will then fulfill that request. 
                A server might even interact with multiple clients simultaneously.

Network Devices
            
            Firewall:   This is a network security device that monitors inbound and outbound traffic 
                        and decides whether to allow or block traffic based on a set of rules. 
                        Firewalls can be hardware devices or software applications.

            Router:     This is a device that connects two networks or subnetworks. 
                        It is commonly used to connect your home network to the Internet.

            Switch:     This is a device that passes network traffic between devices on the same network.

            Wireless Access Point (WAP): This is a device that allows wireless capable devices to connect to a wired network.

Network Topologies 
        
        Fully connected:    Every device is connected to every other device. 
                            This makes for a very fast, highly resilient network, but it is expensive.

        Mesh: Nodes are connected to whichever devices they can reach. This type of network is cheap and resilient but slow.

        Star :  Nodes are connected to central devices. Those central nodes are normally connected to other central nodes. 
                This is a cost-effective way to make a reasonably fast network. Large networks are stars made up of many other stars.
