A router passes traffic between two networks. A switch only handles traffic inside of its own LAN.

How the internet works?
    The internet is a global network of computers and servers that communicate with each other 
        using a common language called the Internet Protocol (IP).
    When you want to access a website or send an email, your device (e.g., phone or computer) 
        sends a request to a server using the IP address of the server.

IP          Internet Protocol 
            Is a unique identifier (string of characters) assigned to every device that is connected to the internet.
            IP addresses allow devices to communicate with each other over the internet by identifying 
                the source and destination of the data being transmitted. 
                Every device that connects to the internet, whether it is a computer, phone, or other 
                networked device, is assigned a unique IP address by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
                or a local network administrator.
            The address 127.0. 0.1 is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic.

            Protocol:   A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules and conventions that two nodes use to communicate with each other.
                        Set of rules that lays out what each bit in a packet represents.

            IPv4:

            IPv6:

            Public IP:

            Private IP:

DNS         Domain Name system
            It is a system that translates human-readable domain names (such as www.example.com) 
            into IP addresses that machines can understand (such as 192.0.2.1).

TCP         Transmission Control Protocol
            is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data. 
            TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.

Gateway     Is a network device that serves as an entry point for traffic from one network to another.

SubnetMask  Is a 32-bit number that is used to divide an IP address into two parts, a network address and a host address.
            Is used in conjunction with the IP address to determine which part of the address is used for the network 
            and which part is used for the host.
            Subnet is binary



Loopback    A loopback address has been built into the IP domain system in order to allow for a device to send and receive its own data packets.
            The loopback interface refers to the overall system by which network engineers can self-reference a device, 
            or “ping” a device by sending its data packets back to itself.

MAC         Media Access Control
            sometimes referred to as a hardware or physical address, is a unique, 
            12-character alphanumeric attribute that is used to identify individual electronic devices on a network. 
            An example of a MAC address is: 00-B0-D0-63-C2-26.

LAN         Local Area Network
            Is a network confined to a small, localized area. Home WiFi networks and small business networks are common examples of LANs.

WAN         Wide Area Network
            Is a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances.
            Setting up a WAN allows your LANs to share resources safely and efficiently.
            It also allows you to set up another line of defense between your users and the Internet.

            Technically, any large network that spreads out over a wide geographic area is a WAN. 
            The Internet itself is considered a WAN.
            each office typically has its own local area network, or LAN, and these LANs connect via a WAN. 
            These long connections may be formed in several different ways, including leased lines, VPNs, or IP tunnels

VPN         Virtual Private Network
            Is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. 
            The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted.
            Any traffic you wish to keep confidential crossing the internet should use a VPN
            common reasons to use it include privacy, protection, and anonymity. 

ISP         Internet Service Provider

NIC         Network Interface Controller
            Is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, that allows a computer to connect to a network.
            Every NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address assigned to it. 
            A MAC address is made up of six hexadecimal numbers, usually separated by colons. 

Node        endpoints on the network.
            Devices on a network are called nodes.
            the connection point among network devices such as routers, printers, or switches that can receive 
            and send data from one endpoint to the other.

Network Models  

            Peer-to-Peer:
                Peer-to-peer: can share files or other resources with any other peer. 
                These are usually set up as an ad-hoc way to share files, printers, databases, etc., between two devices.

            Client-server:
                one host (the server) makes resources available to other hosts (the clients). 
                A client will request resources from the server. The server will then fulfill that request. 
                A server might even interact with multiple clients simultaneously.

Network Devices
            
            Firewall:   This is a network security device that monitors inbound and outbound traffic 
                        and decides whether to allow or block traffic based on a set of rules. 
                        Firewalls can be hardware devices or software applications.

            Router:     This is a device that connects two networks or subnetworks. 
                        It is commonly used to connect your home network to the Internet.

            Switch:     This is a device that passes network traffic between devices on the same network.

            Wireless Access Point (WAP): This is a device that allows wireless capable devices to connect to a wired network.

Network Topologies 
        
        Fully connected:    Every device is connected to every other device. 
                            This makes for a very fast, highly resilient network, but it is expensive.

        Mesh: Nodes are connected to whichever devices they can reach. This type of network is cheap and resilient but slow.

        Star :  Nodes are connected to central devices. Those central nodes are normally connected to other central nodes. 
                This is a cost-effective way to make a reasonably fast network. Large networks are stars made up of many other stars.


Encoding
    Encoding is when data is changed into a different format for one reason or another. 
    It usually makes it easier to use, read, or take up less space. 
    The data is not meant to be obscured, but it is not always obvious what the data is. 
    It has been around for a long time in one form or another, from hieroglyphs to shorthand to Morse code.
        Encoding Schemes
            ASCII
            BINARY 
            DECIMAL
            BASE64

Encryption
    Is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. 
        Encryption standard
            DES & 3DES
                DES is a symmetric cipher, meaning the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data. 
                It uses a key that is 56 bits in length.
            AES
                AES is another symmetric cipher but has much longer keys, 
                meaning it is harder to crack than DES or 3DES.
            RSA
                RSA is asymmetric encryption, which means that one key is used to encrypt data, 
                and a separate key is used to decrypt it. 
                You first must generate a public/private key pair to use it. 
                Crypto utilities generate the keys with pairs of extremely large prime numbers. 
                You use the public key to encrypt and the private key to decrypt.
            Elliptical Curve
                Iis like RSA because it is an asymmetric encryption standard that uses 
                a public/private key pair. It differs in the way it generates the keys. 
                ECC uses the mathematics of elliptical curves to come up with these keys. 
                It is computationally less expensive than RSA encryption.
