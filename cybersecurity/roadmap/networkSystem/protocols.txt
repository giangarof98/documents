TCP:    Transmission Control Protocol
        Is a communication protocol used in computer networks.
        It is a reliable and connection-oriented protocol that ensures the delivery of data packets from one 
            network device to another in a secure and orderly manner.
        Is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data. 
        TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.

        When two network devices want to communicate using TCP, they first establish a connection by performing a "three-way handshake."
        During this process, the devices exchange a series of messages to confirm that they are both ready to 
            communicate and establish a reliable connection.
        
        Once the connection is established, the devices can send data packets back and forth.

        When the communication is complete, the devices close the connection by performing a "four-way handshake" 
            to confirm that all the data has been transmitted and the connection can be terminated.

        How does it works?
            TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained 
                until the applications at each end have finished exchanging messages.

            TCP performs the following actions:
                1.determines how to break application data into packets that networks can deliver;
                2.sends packets to, and accepts packets from, the network layer;
                3.manages flow control;
                4.handles retransmission of dropped or garbled packets, as it's meant to provide error-free data transmission; and
                5.acknowledges all packets that arrive.

        Easy words:
            Basically, tcp is a protocol connection which work is to send data with the help of the ip protocol


UDP:    User Datagram Protocol
        A transport layer communication protocol, UDP is a very common protocol for voice and video traffic.
        Is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups.
        It is a simple and connectionless protocol that provides a way to send data packets over the network without 
            the overhead of establishing and maintaining a connection.

        UDP is commonly used for real-time applications such as audio and video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP 
            (Voice over Internet Protocol) because it provides low latency and faster transfer of data packets.
        
        However, it is not suitable for applications that require reliable delivery of data, such as file transfers or email.

        Overall, UDP is a lightweight and fast protocol that is useful for certain types of 
            applications that do not require reliable delivery of data.

        How does it work?
            Like all networking protocols, UDP is a standardized method for transferring data between two computers in a network.
            It sends packets (units of data transmission) directly to a target computer, without establishing a connection first, 
                indicating the order of said packets, or checking whether they arrived as intended.

    
TCP - UDP Difference:   
    UDP is faster but less reliable than TCP.
    TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless.
    While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly.
