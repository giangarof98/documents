Variables

The Java variables have mainly three types: Local, Instance and Static.
Variable in Java is a data container that stores the data values during Java program execution.
Every variable is assigned a data type, which designates the type and quantity of values it can hold.
Variable is a memory location name of the data. 

Data Types are divided into two group:
    Primitive - byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
    Non-Primitive - String, Arrays and Classes

The goal of a program is to do something with data, or in other words, stuff you put into your program.
Your program uses a variable to manipulate the data.
More specifically, it is a container used to store a piece of data that your program may need for its processing.

A variable is composed of three elements: name, value, and type.

To declare a constant in Java, you need to use the keyword "final"; othersiwe, just declare String.
To print something, must be include within a class.
char is used to store one character; with String you can store any text
    char myChar = 'a';
    String myString = "My string";
    *notice the single and double quotes.

//EXAMPLE
            public class test {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int age = 25;
                String name = "Jhon Doe";
                System.out.println("i'm " + name + ", i'm " + age + " years old");
            }
            }
