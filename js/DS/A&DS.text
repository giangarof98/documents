Algorithms and Data structure

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns


Algorithm
    A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
    Another name for a function - block of instructions to perform a task.

    1) Problem solving
        Understand the problem
            -restate the problem in your own words
            -inputs that go into the problem
            -output that should come from from the solution to the problem
            -can the output be determined from the input? Do i have enough information to solve the problem?
            -label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem
        Concrete Examples
            Explore examples
            Follow a model or example which will provide a eventual solution to understand your approach
                -start with simple examples
                -progress to more complex examples
        Break it down
            Write out the steps you need to take
        Solve or Simplify
            If you cant solve the problem, solve a simpler one
            Simplify:
                Find the core difficulty
                Ignore that difficulty (temporaly)
                Write a simplified solution
                Incorporate that difficulty back in
        Refactor
            If the code accomplish the task, refactor it. Make it better
                check the solution
                derive the result differently
                understand it at a glance
                use the method or method for some other problem
                improve the performance
                other ways to write the code/refactor
                how other people solved this problem


    2) Problem Solving Patterns
            Master problem patterns, improve the approach to solve problems

                Frecuency Counter
                    
                Multiple Pointers
                Sliding Window
                Divide and Conquer
                Dynamic programming
                Greedy Algorithms
                Backtraking
