//Loops
    Block of code that aim to do something repeatly.
    Repeat something some number of times.

    //For Loop
        for(initalExpresion; conditionExpresion; incrementExpresion){
            ...
        }

        -initalExpresion:       Where initialize the execution of the code.
        -conditionExpresion:    Expresion which will define the condition, if the value is true, the loop statements execute. 
                                Otherwise the for loop terminates.
        -incrementExpresion:    Runs every time after the code block has been executed
    

    //For in Loop
        Loops through the properties of an Object
        Will return all the values of the properties Object

        for(let i in <array/object>){}

    //For of Loop
        Return the values sourced from an iterable object
        for(let i of <array/object>){}

    //Do...While
        Create a loop that executes a specific statement until the test evaluates to false.
        Until the while block reach to false.
        do{
            statement
        } while(condition)


    //While ...
        Will create a loop and follow the rule while the condition is true
        while( condition ){
            statement
        }
