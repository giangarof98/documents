Object Oriented Programming

    Everything is a object.
    It is used to structure a software program into simple, 
        reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
        which are used to create individual instances of objects.

    Objects are class instances 

        class Player:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name
            
            def run(self):
                print('run')
        
        player1 = Player()




        __init__:
            constructor

        Self:
            The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, 
                and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
            With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.
            It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, 
                but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class
