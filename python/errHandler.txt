Error Handler
    The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
    The except block lets you handle the error.
    The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
    The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

Error Handling
    Use:
        Try:
            block of code
        except:
            block of code
        else:
            block of code
        finally
            block of code
        

        raise
        except  TypeError
                NameError
                ZeroDivisionError
                ValueError

Debug and test
    Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors or bugs in software code. 
        It involves finding the source of the problem and fixing it. Testing, on the other hand, 
        is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find 
        whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. It involves executing the system 
        and comparing its actual behavior to the expected behavior. Both are important for ensuring 
        the quality and reliability of software.
