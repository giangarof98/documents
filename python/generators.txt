Generators

    generators are special iterators that allow you to create efficient, 
        memory-friendly iterators that can generate a sequence of values on the fly. 
        They are defined like a normal function but use the yield keyword instead of return.

    A generator function is called like a normal function, but it returns an iterator object 
        that can be used to iterate over the values generated by the function.
        Each time the generator function is called, it resumes execution from where it left off 
        and continues until it encounters the next yield statement.
