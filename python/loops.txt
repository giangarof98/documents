    Iterable
        is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a for-loop. 
        Familiar examples of iterables include lists, tuples, and strings - any such sequence can be iterated over in a for-loop.

    
    for loop

    for ... in 

    while loop
        while the condition is true... do the task


    break:
        Loop control statement, its used to control the sequence of the loop
        
    continue:
        returns the control to the beggining of the loop, reject all the remaining statements
        in the current iteration and moves the control back to the top of the loop
    pass:
        do nothing, pass the task
