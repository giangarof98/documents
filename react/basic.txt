//Constructor function
    constructor(props)
        Initial setup
        The constructor is a method thatâ€™s automatically called during the creation of an object from a class.
        If your page is stateless, you can ommit constructor function. otherwise, use it
        Constructor use one argument, props. When calling super(props, it registers your class as a react component
