Ways to create a react project
    npx create-react-app 
    npm create vite@latest

To export
    export default ComponentName
    export default ComponentName(){}
    export {ComponentName}
To import
    import ComponentName from './location.js'
    import {ComponentName} from './location.js'

JSX
    Syntax extension for JS
    Its not 'legal' JS on its own, so it must be transpiled
    It's how react render the html code.
    JSX allows write HTML elements in javascript, place them into the DOM, without use createElement or appendChild() Methods
    The file extension could be .js or .jsx. The difference is you are letting know that you're using .jsx syntax

        JSX Rules
            You must explicity close self-closing element <element/>
            Components can only return a single element

React Fragments
    Allow you to group multiple React elements together without introducing any additional HTML elements in the rendered output.
    Useful when you need to return multiple elements from a component, but you don't want to wrap them in a single parent element.

To Style
    Use className='' in the element tag. Since 'class' is a reserved keyword in react

Props
    properties to pass data from one to another Component
    Are like arguments that can be provided to the component
    inmutable (can't change value)

State
    State is a specific data of an instance of a component. Its mutable, it can be changed
    Important part of react which allows to interact with the application component.
    Internal data specific to a component; Data that changes over time
    Instance attribute on a component

    What does state track?
        UI logic; the changing state of the interface.

    Using State
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
        count -> returns the state itself
        setCount -> return a function to change the piece of state

        useState must be used inside a component



What's a component?
    Its a function
    Block of react
    Combine JS logic and JSX presentation
    
    What goes in state?
        Something that'll change
        Form information
        Data fetched from api 
        A variable that 'decides' whether something is showing or hidden 
    

    ClassComponent
        class First extends React.Component{
            render(){
                return (
                    <div>
                        <h1>Hello!</h1>
                        <h2>Hello!</h2>
                        <p>{3*6}</p>
                    </div>
                )
            }
        }


    Function Component
        function myfunc(){
            const mood = ['happy', 'angry', 'sad', 'hungry', 'cool']
            return mood[Math.floor(Math.random() * mood.length)]
        }
        const First = () => {
            return <h1>{myfunc()}</h1>
        }

        function First(){
            return <h1>Hello!</h1>
        }


To render the React code 
    ReactDOM.render(<First/>, document.getElementById('root'))




//Constructor function
    constructor(props)
        Initial setup
        The constructor is a method thatâ€™s automatically called during the creation of an object from a class.
        If your page is stateless, you can ommit constructor function. otherwise, use it
        Constructor use one argument, props. When calling super(props, it registers your class as a react component
